## Lab 9

[Home](https://liv-edi.github.io/cit281/)

In this lab we worked throught the GitHub Learning Lab 'Create a release based workflow' course.

Technologies used for this lab:
- Chrome
- GitHub

The purpose of this lab was to get familiar with GitHub pull requests, releases, branches, and GitHub in general.

In doing this lab I found it fairly easy although I did get stuck on one step that I could not for the life of me figure out.
